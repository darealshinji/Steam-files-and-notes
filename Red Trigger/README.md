To enable ZQSD movement on AZERTY keyboards copy `Input.ini` into
`C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\RedTrigger\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor`

You can also edit the file to bind movements to something else, i.e. to make it
more friendly to left-handers.

PS: keep a backup just in case the game overwrites the content.
