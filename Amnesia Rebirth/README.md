Skip Intro Level
----------------

You can use the file `AutoSave_01-01-plane-wreckage_2000_01_01_00_00_00_0.sav` to skip the whole
intro sequence level of the game.
To do so you need to copy it to your save files located
at `$HOME/.local/share/frictionalgames/Amnesia Rebirth/Main/<profilename+ID or "Default">` on Linux
or `C:\Users\<username>\Documents\My Games\Amnesia Rebirth\Main\<profilename+ID or "Default">` on Windows.


Skippable Logos
---------------

The Steam user crate (https://steamcommunity.com/id/crater_) made a mod that allows you to skip the
logos appearing when starting the game by pressing mouse buttons or keys.
You need to copy the file `MenuHandler.hps` into `steamapps/common/Amnesia Rebirth/script/custom/modules`

To always skip the logos add the setting `SkipLogo="true"` to the `<Game ... />` tag of your `*_user_settings.cfg` file.

The mod was posted on the workshop: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2278666872
