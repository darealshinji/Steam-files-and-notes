Bug fixes on Linux
------------------
Add `-screen-fullscreen 0` to the launch options to fix the fullscreen bug (black screen after start).

To prevent further creashes, copy the directory `BATIM_Data` (which contains the missing `libCSteamworks.so`
and `libsteam_api.so` files) into the `Bendy and the Ink Machine` game directory.
